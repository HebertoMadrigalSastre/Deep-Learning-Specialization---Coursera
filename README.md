# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera
### [Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

Instructor: [Andrew Ng, DeepLearning.ai]()


The current proyect contains my solutions to the PAs (Programming assignments) of the Deep Learning specialization. The specialization cover topics like: CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization; and the PAs are based on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation and natural language processing.
